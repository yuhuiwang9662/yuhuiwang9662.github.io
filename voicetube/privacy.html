    <section id="intro">
      <p><strong>VoiceTube</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) provides a voice-based AI chat and video search experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, retain, and protect information when you use our app.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="info-we-collect">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our services.</p>

      <h3>a. Voice and Audio Data</h3>
      <p>When you speak to the app, your voice input is processed to generate AI responses or to perform actions (for example, searching or playing YouTube videos). Voice data may be temporarily sent to third-party cloud services (such as speech-to-text or AI model providers) to transcribe or generate responses. We do <strong>not</strong> permanently store raw voice recordings unless you explicitly opt in and are informed otherwise.</p>

      <h3>b. Usage Data</h3>
      <p>We may collect anonymous or aggregated usage data such as feature usage, device type, language settings, app crashes, timestamps, and other diagnostics to improve performance and reliability.</p>

      <h3>c. Account and Preferences</h3>
      <p>If you create an account or save preferences (for example, selected AI character or voice settings), that data is stored and linked to your user identifier.</p>

      <h3>d. YouTube API Services</h3>
      <p>VoiceTube uses YouTube API Services to search and play videos. Requests and interactions with YouTube are subject to Google’s policies and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <section id="how-we-use">
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process voice input and generate AI responses;</li>
        <li>Search for and play YouTube videos based on voice commands;</li>
        <li>Improve the accuracy and quality of AI interactions;</li>
        <li>Maintain, secure, and optimize the app experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Temporary voice and text data may be retained for a short period for processing, quality improvement, or diagnostics. We delete or anonymize voice data after processing unless retention is legally required or you explicitly consent to longer storage.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-sharing">
      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We may share limited data with trusted service providers that help us operate the app (for example, cloud hosts, AI model providers, analytics providers). All service providers are contractually restricted from using data for other purposes.</p>
      <p>We do not share or sell user data to advertisers or unrelated third parties.</p>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. However, no system is completely secure; we encourage safe usage practices and strong account passwords where applicable.</p>
