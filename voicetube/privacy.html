    <h1>Privacy Policy for VoiceTube</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: October 25, 2025</p>
    
    <p>VoiceTube ("we," "our," or "us") provides a voice-based AI chat and video search experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide and improve our services.</p>

    <h3>a. Voice and Audio Data</h3>
    <p>When you speak to the app, your voice input is processed to generate AI responses or to perform actions (like searching or playing YouTube videos). Voice data may be temporarily sent to cloud services (such as OpenAI or Google Speech) for transcription or AI response generation. We do not permanently store your raw voice recordings.</p>

    <h3>b. Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect anonymous information such as app interactions, features used, device type, language settings, and crash logs. This helps us improve performance and user experience.</p>

    <h3>c. Account and Preferences (if applicable)</h3>
    <p>If you create an account or save preferences (e.g., selected AI character, voice settings), this information is securely stored and linked to your user ID.</p>

    <h3>d. YouTube API Services</h3>
    <p>VoiceTube uses YouTube API Services to search and play videos. When you use this feature, your requests are handled in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Process voice input and generate AI responses</li>
        <li>Search and play YouTube videos based on your voice commands</li>
        <li>Improve the accuracy and quality of the AI interactions</li>
        <li>Maintain and enhance app performance and security</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>We do not sell or rent your personal data.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Temporary voice and text data may be retained for a short period to improve AI response quality or diagnose performance issues. We automatically delete or anonymize voice data after processing unless legally required to retain it.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We may share limited data with trusted service providers that help us operate the app (for example, AI language models or cloud hosting). All partners comply with data protection laws and are restricted from using your data for any other purpose.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>We do not share or sell user data to advertisers or other third parties.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is 100% secure, and we encourage you to use the app responsibly.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the app and on our website. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
